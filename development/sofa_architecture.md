# üõãÔ∏è Secure Open Format Architecture (SOFA) for Data Products

**SOFA** is a composable, Zero Trust-aligned architecture for building secure, tenant-owned, and portable Data Products using open formats and ephemeral compute. It blends fine-grained IAM, open storage and table formats, and modern orchestration to support auditability, portability, and compliance by design.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Enforce **Zero Trust** principles across all pipeline layers  
- Support **data portability** using open formats (Parquet, DuckDB)  
- Empower **tenant ownership** through isolated, S3-compatible buckets  
- Replace static infrastructure with **stateless, ephemeral components**

## üß± Core Architecture Stack

| **Layer**       | **Component**          | **Role**                                                                 |

| Storage         | Tigris Object Storage  | S3-compatible backend for tenant-isolated Parquet data                  |
| Lakehouse       | DuckLake + DuckDB      | Analytical engine with snapshot isolation and open format support       |
| Compute         | GitHub Codespaces      | Ephemeral dev environments with no local data exposure                  |
| Orchestration   | Tower.dev              | Python-native workflow automation and secrets rotation                  |

## üîê Zero Trust Enforcement

| **Principle**           | **Enforcement**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No implicit trust       | No reliance on VPCs or internal IPs; all access via IAM                         |
| Per-request authN/Z     | Tigris IAM + Doppler-injected credentials + IP restrictions                     |
| Least privilege         | IAM-scoped keys per project, environment, and object prefix                     |
| Short-lived credentials | Tower.dev flows periodically rotate access keys and propagate to Doppler        |
| Secure transport        | All ingress/egress flows through Tailscale exit nodes                           |
| Auditable access        | Logs from Doppler, Tailscale, Tigris, Tower sent to central SIEM                |
| Data exfil prevention   | Codespaces restricts USB, clipboard, and local disk access                      |

## üîì Open Format Principles

- **Open File Formats**: All datasets stored as columnar Parquet  
- **Open Query Engine**: DuckDB for local/embedded; MotherDuck for hosted SQL  
- **Interoperable Storage**: Tigris object storage with S3-compatible APIs  
- **Tenant Isolation**: Each client has dedicated buckets and IAM policies  
- **Vendor Neutrality**: No proprietary formats; all interfaces are replaceable  

---

## üîÅ Secrets & Key Rotation Flow

1. **Generate** Tigris access key with IP and path restrictions  
2. **Store** in Doppler (`TIGRIS_KEY_ID`, `TIGRIS_KEY_SECRET`)  
3. **Inject** into runtime:  
   - **Codespaces** via `doppler run`  
   - **Tower.dev jobs** via `doppler secrets download`  
4. **Rotate** with Tower-scheduled task:  
   - Call `RotateAccessKey` via Tigris API  
   - Update Doppler using CLI/API  
5. **Restrict** access using IAM conditions like:  

```json
"Condition": {
  "IpAddress": { "aws:SourceIp": "198.51.100.42" }
}
```

## üåê Environment Access Model

| **Environment** | **Purpose**        | **Routing**            | **Secret Source** | **IAM Constraints**              |
|-----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Codespaces      | Dev & analytics    | Tailscale exit node     | Doppler           | IP + path + action               |
| Tower.dev       | CI / orchestration | Tailscale or NAT        | Doppler           | IP + path + TTL-based rotation   |
| MotherDuck      | Query layer        | Direct static IP access | *(optional)*      | Read-only IAM with prefix scope  |

- All access bound to identity, IP, path, and method  
- No hardcoded or shared credentials  
- Audit trail across all layers (secrets, storage, access)  

### üß≥ Portability
- Open formats (Parquet, DuckDB) across the entire lakehouse  
- S3-compatible storage for tenant-controlled exports  
- Tenant-owned, tenant-isolated, and vendor-neutral by default  

### ‚öôÔ∏è Operational Simplicity
