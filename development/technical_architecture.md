# Technical Architecture

## Overview

This document defines IndustryVault's technical architecture, including platform capabilities, technology stack, and architectural principles that guide product development decisions.

### Architecture Evolution

IndustryVault's technical architecture is evolving to incorporate the **Secure Open Format Architecture (SOFA)** as our foundational approach for data products. SOFA provides a Zero Trust-aligned, composable architecture that emphasizes security, portability, and operational simplicity.

For detailed information about SOFA, see [SOFA Architecture Documentation](sofa_architecture.md).

## Architectural Principles

### 1. **Cloud-Native Design**
- Microservices architecture for scalability and maintainability
- Container-based deployment for portability and consistency
- Auto-scaling capabilities for variable workloads
- Multi-region deployment for high availability

### 2. **Security First**
- Zero-trust security model
- End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions
- Regular security audits and compliance certifications

### 3. **Data Governance**
- Comprehensive data lineage tracking
- Data quality monitoring and validation
- Regulatory compliance built into architecture
- Audit trails for all data operations

### 4. **Performance and Scalability**
- Horizontal scaling for data processing
- Caching strategies for improved performance
- Load balancing for high availability
- Performance monitoring and optimization

## Technology Stack

### SOFA Integration

Our technology stack incorporates the **Secure Open Format Architecture (SOFA)** as the foundation for data products:

#### Core SOFA Components
- **Secrets Management**: Doppler for centralized secret storage and injection
- **Storage**: Tigris Object Storage for S3-compatible, tenant-isolated data
- **Lakehouse**: DuckLake + DuckDB for analytical processing with open formats
- **Compute**: GitHub Codespaces for ephemeral development environments
